<p style="font-family: monospace">My professional work is primarily focused on HPC and Ultrascale systems. I've contributed a number of packages to the Spack package manager via RIT Research Computing. Soon, I am excited to be starting research on workload management on ultrascale systems, specifically on how a cluser can maximize efficiency, availability, and reliability on systems operating at high altitudes. This research will primarily be based on the Batsim project, along with validation on real world systems.</p>
