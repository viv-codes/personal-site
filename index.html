<p style="font-family: monospace">Hey! I'm Vivian, a second-year undergraduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Computing and Information Technologies. Professional, I am primarily focused on High Performance Compute and Ultrascale systems. Personally, I enjoy spending time on or around bikes, in the outdoors, reading, and spending time with my partner.</p>

<!-- In the past, I have worked for RIT's Research Computing department as a platform engineer, and with the Defense Finance Accounting Service in an application development role. I am currently employed by the Ultrascale Systems Research Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory in a research role. More information on my research can be found under the 'What I do' tab. -->
