<p style="font-family: monospace">Hey! I'm Vivian, a second-year undergraduate student at Rochester Institute of Technology, majoring in Computing and Information Technologies. I work for the Los Alamos National Lab's High Performance Computing Workload Management group, studying how to maximize efficiency on clusters with high per-node MTBF. Personally, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, climbing, biking, reading, and spending time with my partner.</p>
