Over time, places and their connotations shift. While in the past I felt at home in the backwoods of Maine, I feel increasingly disconnected from them, as I move further and further away, and have less time there. This body of work focuses on that connection, and the threads of it that I felt while I was back there for the winter. These are places that are meaningful to me, that I have visited and photographed since my first year with a camera.  <br><br>
